# 1.Sum and Difference:
# Question: Write a Python program to take two numbers as input and output their sum and difference.
# Example Input: 10, 5

# Sum: 15  
# Difference: 5

# 2.Product and Division:
# Question: Write a program that accepts two float numbers and prints their product and division result.
# Example Input: 8.5, 2.0
# Product: 17.0  
# Division: 4.25
# numbers = input("enter a two float numbers :")
# a, b = map(float, numbers.split(","))
# product_result = a * b
# division_result = a / b
# print("product:", product_result)
# print("division:", division_result)


# 3.Modulus and Power:
# Question: Take two integers as input and calculate the modulus and power of the first number raised to the second.
# Example Input: 5, 3

# Modulus: 2  
# Power: 125
# a = int(input("enter a (a) value:"))
# b = int(input("enter a (b) value:"))
# modulus_result = a % b
# power_result = a ** b
# print("modulus (a % b):", modulus_result)
# print("power (a ** b):", power_result)

# 4.Relational Operators:
# Question: Write a program that checks if a given number is greater than 50 and less than 100.
# Example Input: 75
# True
# n = 75
# if n >= 50 or n <= 100:
#     print("True")
# else:
#     print("False")

# 5.Logical Operators:
# Question: Write a Python program that accepts three numbers and checks if all three numbers are positive using logical operators.
# Example Input: 10, 20, 30
# True
# a = 10
# b = 20
# c = 30
# if a >= 10 or b >= 20 or c >= 30:
#     print("True")
# else:
#     print("False")

# 6.Swap Numbers Without a Temporary Variable:
# Question: Write a program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable, utilizing arithmetic operators.
# Example Input: a = 5, b = 10
# a = 10  
# b = 5

# 7.Even or Odd Using Arithmetic Operators:
# Question: Write a program to check if a number is even or odd using arithmetic operators.
# Example Input: n = 4
# Even
# n = 5
# if n % 2 == 0:
#     print("Even")
# else:
#     print("Odd")







# 10.Check Range of a Number:
# Question: Write a program to check if a number lies within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) using relational operators.
# Example Input: Number: 42
# True
